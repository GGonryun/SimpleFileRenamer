# SimpleFileRenamer
This is a simple console app I first created when learning how to manage files in C#

## Usage:
After building the instructions run the .exe which can be found in the: `ConsoleApp1\bin\Release\` folder. It will prompt you for a full filepath. Afterwards it will ask you for both the original file extension and the new file extension.
Upon completion it will remove all old files as well.

ex:
```
Input a folder path
"C:\Users\BojackHorseman\Desktop\Notes\"
File type to rename
"txt md"
```

This will convert all files located at the specified path from .txt to .md.
